# SPAUN

Serial Protocol / AUN

For use with NFS_SERIAL ROM.

*****

Update 16/03/22

First proper version, now in C++ and object orientated.

A configuration file called spaun.cfg is required to define the network (see example).

Must be used with latest ROM version which allows higher data rates.
